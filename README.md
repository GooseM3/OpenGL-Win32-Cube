# OpenGL-Win32-Cube
## Matthew Merrick 

This project uses c++, as well as OpenGL and Win32 to render and 
draw a cube while rotating the camera around said cube. I tried to limit external libary usage as much
as possible and tried to download as little as possible.

-C++ [c++20]
-OpenGL
-Win32
## Features
-  main.cpp
- cube.shader
- Render.cpp
- Window.cpp



## Installation
- To Start you need set the correct file path insde setup.bat
- it should look something like the ```call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"```, but it will depend on where you have it installed. 
```sh
setup.bat
```
## Building Program 
```sh
build.bat
```
- this should build the program and give you a .exe that will work on windows or allow you to run start.bat which will also start it. 
## Running Program 
```sh
start.bat
```
